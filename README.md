# My-Task-Board

## User Story

As a developer I want to create a Task Board
So that I can log and organize my projects and manage and track their progress.

## Description 

When the page loads I can see an oranized task board to plan and track my project tasks. 
I am able to click a button to add a new task that's due. 
Once I enter the name of my task, decription and due Date then I will see my new task displayed on thre page. 
The page should organize each task according to the 3 categories. I want the tasks to be assigned a color depending on the status of the task.
I will also be able to drag the tasks to a new column when I want to update the status of the task.
Once I have completed the task I can then delete the task from the page.

## Code Source

In this project I was given starter code to modify and add my own code to the javascript file. 
I was provided this starter code in GitLab under the Coding Bootcamp at UT at Austin repo.
